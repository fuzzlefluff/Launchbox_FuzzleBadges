# Launchbox_FuzzleBadges
An extension plugin that adds a ton of badges for launchbox for things like source versions, platforms, and some misc custom values and tracking. 
Some are simple replacements for existing ones but I wanted my own icon embeded in so I made a duplicate badge. 

### If you don't want all of these, just recompile it and exclude the classes you don't want

## Misc Functional
* **Overwrite Icon for Game Completed**

* **Overwrite Icon for Favorite**

* **Overwrite Icon for Installed (needs download)**

* **Custom Field "Needs Purchase" == True, display a money sign**

This is to keep track of what I want on steam sales that I own on other launchers, because $5 to get it on steam is worth

* **Custom Field "100% Completed" == True, display a platinum trophy**

To keep track of the games you platinum

* **Replacement for "New" Badge**

Checks to see if the game has a lastplayed value, if its null the badge will display, otherwise it won't, 
allows to mark several games as played without tediously launching them all by simply setting them all to a last played date
